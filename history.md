### The history of this course material
This course originated from the Combine  Australia ( http://combine.org.au/) __RNAseq analysis in R__ materials (http://combine-australia.github.io/2016-05-11-RNAseq/ ). We are extremely grateful to the authors for making their materials available; Maria Doyle, Belinda Phipson, Matt Ritchie, Anna Trigos, Harriet Dashnow, Charity Law.  
However, like most taught materials in fast-moving fields, our usage has evolved and we have had ideological and
peadgogical changes in how we deliver the material and its content.   

One area concerns the usage of EdgeR vs. using DESeq for analysis of Differential Expression.    

Another concerns employing pre-constructed .Rmd files compared to the 'live-coding' teaching promoted by
the Carpentries (Software & Data).
